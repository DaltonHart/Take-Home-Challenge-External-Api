# Photo Lightbox
Create a web page that shows a photo in a lightbox view, with the
ability to move to the next/previous photos and display the photo
title. You can use any public API that returns photos (i.e. Flickr,
Instagram, Google Image Search, Yahoo Image Search)

It should run without errors in the latest versions of Chrome,
Safari, Firefox and IE.

Please send the code (Github repos are fine) and a URL where the
working lightbox can be seen.
